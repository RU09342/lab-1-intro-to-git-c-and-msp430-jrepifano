# Intro to Embedded with Tang, Section 3
# Lab Exercise 1: Introduction to C, Git, and the MSP430
# Dependent libraries: MSP430.h, and math.h (given).
# The goal of the program was to take in 2 numbers and a operator character and perform the operation.
# This assignment was completed using a switch statement.
# This switch statement checks for each operator character and then gives the formula.
# For example if the Operator charater is '+' the switch statement says 'num1 + num2'.
# The result is stored in the float result variable and is returned.
# I verified the function by using breakpoints and the code composer debugger to step through the code while the variables change.
# The verification and testing was done on the MSP430G2553.
